The first six lines describe the cage shapes. All cells assigned the same number share a common cage.

The seventh line contains the cage labels. Which cage a label belongs to depends on its index in the line. 
So, 80âˆ— is the condition for cage 0, while 6 is the label upon cage 12. A label will always be a number, 
followed optionally by an operator symbol.

You should print your solution to standard out, as follows:

5 4 3 1 6 2
4 6 5 2 3 1
3 2 1 4 5 6
1 3 6 5 2 4
6 1 2 3 4 5
2 5 4 6 1 3

Each row must be on a line by itself. Each number is to be separated from the next by a single space.

If a puzzle is unsolvable, you should output No solution.
